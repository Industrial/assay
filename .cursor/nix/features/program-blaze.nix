  # blaze (Indexable Inc) is a daemon-backed Rust build tool: `blaze build`,
  # `check`, `run`, `test` take cargo's flags and rebuild only what changed.
  # It ships its own toolchain — it never runs rustc, cargo, clippy or rustfmt,
  # and `rust-toolchain` files are not read.
  #
  # Installed from the pinned GitHub release, as program-moon and program-assay
  # are. The upstream flake builds blaze (and LLVM 23) from source with PGO,
  # which is hours of work per version bump for the same bytes.
  #
  # The release is NOT pinned in Cargo.toml: `[workspace.metadata.blaze] version`
  # makes blaze hand off to a release it downloads into `~/.blaze/versions`,
  # which would bypass this pin. This feature is the single pin.
  #
  # Pin the canary line, not `stable` (0.20261027.0), which cannot work here:
  # its bundled `gcc-ld/ld.lld` is a generic-linux dynamic executable NixOS
  # cannot exec (every link fails), `blaze test` fails to compile libtest's
  # `test_main_inner`, and it misreads `RUST_SRC_PATH` — which devenv's
  # `languages.rust` always sets — as the standard library's workspace.
